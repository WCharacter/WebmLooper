# Webm Looper
Simple program for looping webm files. 
This program doesn't actually loop webm files, it just removes the real duration of it and sets it to zero,
so your video already should be looped by you and be long enought to create an illusion of looping. In discord duration of this video will increase until the end of the video.

# Usage
```WebmLooper.exe <filename> [<filename> ...]```
